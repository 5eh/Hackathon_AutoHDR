development of User flow:

- Check benchmark
- Compare functionality
- If compatible, then allow for user image input
  Once the image is input, backend runs ONNX to receive the compare the image
- The review of the image is solely to compare the quality or consistency of the mages

Notes:

- If this is done in a folder, it can be imported collectively and trained collectively.Maybe 1 free "site" per free user, then $200/month after that i they like it, with functional tweaking.
- The user may wnt to self select using a tool
- The ONNX machine will want to review eah sectio

NICE TO HAVE, BUT NOT NEEDED:

- 3D Depth
  Property layout
  Review and improvement model

THINGS TO DO:

- Build ONNX Model
- Add layers to images
- Have an image be able to auto select the products inside of a room
- Create key-pair comparisons
- Allow the AI model to create image changes only to a specific area
